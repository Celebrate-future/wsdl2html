__You've made a web service or sombody has given you a WSDL. So what are the input and output?__ Check the WSDL? No, that's not readable. Instead you can use __wsdl2html__ to __generate a readable HTML page a from WSDL url__

See? You will love it!

__Sometimes as a developer you haven't got the WSDL ready.__ Instead you've just finished the jax-ws stubs:

But you still want a HTML spec right away. In this case you can still use __wsdl2html__ to __generate a readable HTML page from jax-ws stubs__

[Download](/wsdl2html/dist/main/wsdl2html-1.0.3.jar) it and have fun.
